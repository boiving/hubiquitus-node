# Hubiquitus-node

Hubiquitus-node is a Node.JS project that links a client that wants to perform
Publish-Subscribe operations to a XMPP Server. It allows the client to use 
WebSockets to connect and lets him abstract the underlying structure
used by XMPP by only requiring the essential information to perform each action.

## Features

* Can be run separately from the XMPP Server, allowing more flexibility.

* Clients can connect using WebSockets, allowing to use the best
transport for the client type.

* By using **HubiquitusJS** you can simplify the treatment of messages sent
and let **Hubiquitus-Node** take care of the rest.

* Several ports can be used for each transport, each running as a different
process increasing scalability!

## How to Install
### Dependencies

To use **Hubiquitus-Node**, you need Node.JS, NPM and an XMPP Server.

To make it function correctly, the XMPP Server needs to have a `Component connection`
configured.

``` 

###Installation

```
$ npm install git://github.com/hubiquitus/hubiquitus-node.git	
```

## How to use

Once installed, all you need to do is run *hnode.js* with the `component-jid`
and `secret` as options:

```	
$ ./hnode.js --hnode.jid <jid> --hnode.password <secret>
```

If you installed it globally (using 
`npm install -g git://github.com/hubiquitus/hubiquitus-node.git`)
you can run it with `$ hubiquitus-node --hnode.jid <jid> --hnode.password <secret>`

When launched, the server waits for requests by all available transports
in all defined ports.

This server needs a hAPI counterpart (ported to different languages),
for example [hubiquitusjs](https://github.com/hubiquitus/hubiquitusjs).

### Configuring

There are two ways to configure **Hubiquitus-Node**, you can pass command-line
arguments when running it or use a config file. The options, their format, 
their default values and their explanation can all be found in 
[Options](https://github.com/hubiquitus/hubiquitus-node/wiki/Options).

To use a config file you need only to pass one argument: `--config <path>`

* Command-line arguments are always in the format `--option value`.

* Config files are comprised of key-values pairs in the format `key = value`.

```
Note: Blank lines or lines starting with '#' are ignored. 
Keys accepting arrays are specified by passing value1,value2,value3
```
